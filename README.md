# HamTab
A limited feature replacement for HamClock. 
This is an app I totally vibe coded to replicate to an extent the features of HamClock I was using the most.  Feel free to copy it and use it for your purposes.  I will make some updates over time but am probably not entertaining feature requests on this.
